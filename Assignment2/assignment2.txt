1)How do you copy by value a composite data type?
A)Composite data type- assigning a variable just creates a reference to that value once.
  Objects and Arrays are composite data type.
  Objects:There are multiple ways to make copies of objects, especially with the new expanding and improving JavaScript specification.
  Spred operator-
  Console:var obj={name:'vamsi',course:'guvi'};
          var newobj={...obj};
          console.log(newobj);                         o/p:{ name: 'vamsi', course: 'guvi' }
2)why there is a difference in behavior for copying contents in primitive and non primitive type?
A)Becasue,Primitive datat types are immutable, it means we cannot modify the existing value after creating it.
  Non-premitive data types are mutable,it means they can be modified after creating.

3)Use typeof in all the datatypes and check the result
  typeof(1)---------------number
  typeof(1.1)-------------number
  typeof("1.1")-----------string
  typeof(true)------------boolean
  typeof(null)------------object
  typeof(undefined)-------undefined
  typeof([])--------------object
  typeof({})--------------object
4)What is the difference between window, screen, and document in Javascript
A)Window is the main JavaScript object which sits at top of the object heirarchy, aka the global object in a browser. You can access it as window.
  window.screen screen is a small information object about physical screen dimensions.
  window.document document is the main object of the potentially visible or rendered DOM(Document Object Model).
